# Terraform Basic Commands

## Step-01: Introduction
- Understand basic Commands
  - terraform init          # The terraform init command initializes a working directory containing configuration files and installs plugins for required providers.
  - terraform fmt           # The terraform fmt command rewrites configuration files to a canonical format and style.
  - terraform validate      # The terraform validate command validates the configuration files in a directory, referring only to the configuration and not accessing any remote services such as remote state, provider APIs, etc.
  - terraform plan          # The terraform plan command creates an execution plan with a preview of the changes that Terraform will make to your infrastructure.
  - terraform apply         # The terraform apply command executes the actions proposed in a Terraform plan to create, update, or destroy infrastructure.
  - terraform destroy       # The terraform destroy command destroys all objects managed by a Terraform configuration.

## Step-02: Review terraform manifest for EC2 Instance
- **Pre-Conditions-1:** Ensure you have **default-vpc** in that respective region
- **Pre-Conditions-2:** Ensure AMI you are provisioning exists in that region if not update AMI ID 
- **Pre-Conditions-3:** Verify your AWS Credentials in **$HOME/.aws/credentials**
```t
# Terraform Settings Block
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      #version = "~> 3.21" # Optional but recommended in production
    }
  }
}

# Provider Block
provider "aws" {
  profile = "default" # AWS Credentials Profile configured on your local desktop terminal  $HOME/.aws/credentials
  region  = "us-east-1"
}

# Resource Block
resource "aws_instance" "ec2demo" {
  ami           = "ami-04d29b6f966df1537" # Amazon Linux in us-east-1, update as per your region
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

## Step-03: Terraform Core Commands
```t
# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# Terraform Validate
terraform validate

# Terraform Plan to Verify what it is going to create / update / destroy
terraform plan

# Terraform Apply to Create EC2 Instance
terraform apply 
```

## Step-04: Verify the EC2 Instance in AWS Management Console
- Go to AWS Management Console -> Services -> EC2
- Verify newly created EC2 instance



## Step-05: Destroy Infrastructure
```t
# Destroy EC2 Instance
terraform destroy

# Delete Terraform files 
rm -rf .terraform*
rm -rf terraform.tfstate*
```
