# Infrastructure as a Code Introduction

## What is infrastructure as a code?
- In IaC, infrastructure is managed and provisioned through code rather than manually. Configuration files      containing your infrastructure specifications are created by IaC, making it easier to edit and distribute configurations.

# IaC tools
- In many cases, IaC can be achieved using server automation and configuration management tools.
- Here are a few popular options:
    Chef
    Puppet
    Ansible
    Saltstack
    Terraform 
    AWS CloudFormation
    Azure Resource Manager
    Google Cloud Deployment Manager
    Pulumi

## Why does IaC important for DevOps?
- DevOps is made easier by IaC because both teams can use the same description of application deployments. 
- You can deploy to your production environment using the same process as every other environment.
